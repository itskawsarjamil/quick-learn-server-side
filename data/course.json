Objective-C and Swift are the two programming languages that developers can use to build these apps. Apple has three requirements for iOS developers: using a Mac computer running the latest version of macOS, downloading Xcode, and having an active Apple Developer account. Because Apple standardizes iOS development, you're likely to rely on their native APIs and libraries as iOS software development kits (SDKs) as well. If you connect your app to cloud-based services using Apple APIs, you can also use the cloud for storage, database management, and app caching. When you are ready to test your app, you can only do so using an Apple iPhone mobile device. Once the app is complete, and all conditions are met, the final step is listing it in the App Store for iOS users to download."
